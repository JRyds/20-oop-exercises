### Creating a Library App To Practice OOP

A series of 15 chatGPT created exercises that gradually build the functionality of a library application while teaching OOP concepts and array/object methods in JavaScript. The exercises are be structured to progressively develop the application and enhance the understanding of these concepts.

### Exercise 1: Create Book Class

**Objective:** Learn the basics of creating classes in JavaScript.

- Create a `Book` class with properties for title, author, and genre.
- Implement a method to display book information.

### Exercise 2: Create Library Class

**Objective:** Understand class relationships.

- Create a `Library` class with a property to hold an array of books.
- Implement methods to add and remove books from the library.

### Exercise 3: Add Book Instances

**Objective:** Practice creating instances and using class methods.

- Create a few instances of the `Book` class.
- Add these book instances to the library using the `addBook` method.

### Exercise 4: List All Books

**Objective:** Learn array methods.

- Implement a method in the `Library` class to list all books.
- Use array iteration methods to format the display of book information.

### Exercise 5: Find Book by Title

**Objective:** Practice searching within arrays.

- Implement a method in the `Library` class to find a book by its title.
- Use array searching methods (`find` or `filter`).

### Exercise 6: Filter Books by Genre

**Objective:** Enhance array filtering skills.

- Implement a method in the `Library` class to filter books by genre.
- Return a list of books that match the given genre.

### Exercise 7: Remove Book by Title

**Objective:** Practice array manipulation.

- Implement a method to remove a book from the library by its title.
- Use array methods to find and remove the book.

### Exercise 8: Update Book Information

**Objective:** Learn how to update objects within arrays.

- Implement a method to update the information of a book.
- Allow updating of title, author, or genre.

### Exercise 9: Sort Books

**Objective:** Understand sorting algorithms and array sort methods.

- Implement a method to sort books by title, author, or genre.
- Use the array `sort` method.

### Exercise 10: Count Books by Genre

**Objective:** Practice using array reduction methods.

- Implement a method to count the number of books in each genre.
- Use the `reduce` method to tally counts.

### Exercise 11: Save Library State

**Objective:** Learn about data persistence.

- Implement a method to save the library state to local storage.
- Use `JSON.stringify` to convert the library to a string.

### Exercise 12: Load Library State

**Objective:** Continue learning about data persistence.

- Implement a method to load the library state from local storage.
- Use `JSON.parse` to convert the string back to objects.

### Exercise 13: Book Availability

**Objective:** Incorporate boolean properties and logic.

- Add a `checkedOut` property to the `Book` class.
- Implement methods to check out and return books.

### Exercise 14: List Available Books

**Objective:** Combine several skills.

- Implement a method to list only available books.
- Use array filtering and the `checkedOut` property.

### Exercise 15: Advanced Search

**Objective:** Build complex queries.

- Implement a method to search books by multiple criteria (title, author, genre).
- Allow combining different search filters.

These exercises will progressively build the functionality of your library application while teaching you important OOP concepts and array/object methods in JavaScript.
